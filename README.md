Express Boilerplate is a customizable and easy-to-use starter kit for building Node.js web applications with the Express.js framework. It comes pre-configured with essential tools and packages, such as CORS, helmet, and Winston, to help you build robust and secure applications. It also includes a folder structure with pre-defined directories for controllers, middleware, models, and more, to help you organize your codebase and improve maintainability.

## Getting Started

To get started with Express Boilerplate, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/express-boilerplate.git
cd express-boilerplate
npm install
```

You can then start the development server using:

```
npm start
```

This will start the server and restart it automatically whenever you make changes to the code.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure of the project is designed to keep your code organized and maintainable. Here's a brief overview of each folder:

- `api-routes`: Contains the API routes of your application.
- `config`: Contains configuration files for your application.
- `controllers`: Contains the controllers of your application.
- `errors`: Contains custom error classes for your application.
- `loaders`: Contains the code for loading the application.
- `logs`: Contains the log files of your application.

- `validations`: Contains the validation schemas for your application.

## Environment Variables

The application uses the `dotenv` package to load environment variables from a `.env` file. An example `.env` file is included in the `envexample.txt` file. You should create your own `.env` file and update the values as per your requirements.
